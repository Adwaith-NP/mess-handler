I’ve built a mess customer management system designed to run locally on a device, making it easier to manage customer records efficiently. Here’s a quick look at its key features:

✅ Dashboard
	•	Search for customers by name.
	•	Get notified about customers whose subscriptions are expiring within 2 days.
	•	Easily set up leave options via the gear icon.

✅ Add Section
	•	Register new customers seamlessly.

✅ List Section
	•	Filter users based on selected options.

✅ User Details
	•	Click on a customer’s name to view their details in a separate window.
